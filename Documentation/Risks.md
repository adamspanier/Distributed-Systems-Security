# Project-Oriented Risks
[HOME](https://github.com/adamspanier/Distributed-Systems-Security)

What could go wrong in the project and why?

|Risk name (value)  | Impact     | Likelihood | Description |
|-------------------|------------|------------|-------------|
|Cryptographic implementation flaws (40) | 8 | 5 | Issues with implementing the correct cryptography protocol  |
|Inability to simulate real-world attack scenarios (48) | 8 | 6 | The project will culminate with a simulation of cryptography working on a PLC, simulation could be an issue.  |
|Challenges in demonstrating practical exploits (42) | 7 | 6 | The team will not have access to physical PLC's for testing, this could present challenges in simulation and demonstration.  |
|Limited academic research on specific PLC vulnerabilities (64) | 8 | 8 | This project hinges on expanding upon previous academic research; if there is not a sufficient amount of research, it could hamper the project.  |
|Difficulty obtaining comprehensive attack surface data (48) | 6 | 8 | The team needs to know what they are protecting in order to attempt to protect it, if this cannot be obtained, it will hamper the project's path forward.  |
|Constrained testing environments (64) | 8 | 8 | Any testing done on PLC's will be on virtual devices, this could create constraints.  |
|Ethical considerations in vulnerability research (40) | 5 | 8 | Vulnerability research always involves ethics. The team needs to keep in mind ethical considerations for all paths taken and decisions made.  |
|Hardware-level security limitations (42) | 6 | 7 | Due to testing being completed on virtual devices, there will be limitations in what can be completed on them.   |
|Varied understanding of industrial control systems (40) | 5 | 8 | Not all team members have experience working with ICS systems.  |
|Different technical programming skill levels (40) | 5 | 8 | Each team member comes from a different technological background, not all have strong programming or scripting skills.  |
|Communication breakdowns (24) | 4 | 6 | People don't always communicate well, there will be times where communication suffers and could break down.  |
|Unequal workload distribution (24) | 4 | 6 | A full team of 5 people could lead to an unequal workload distribution.  |
|Personality conflicts (30) | 5 | 6 | People don't always communicate well, there will be times where people do not "get along" and conflicts could arise.  |
|Misaligned project expectations (20) | 4 | 5 | It is important to set expectations at the beginning of the project and keep them appropriately set throughout the project.  |
|Individual motivation inconsistencies (30) | 6 | 5 | People could face issues with other classes or in their personal lives where motivation to work on this project becomes an issue.  |
|Time management challenges (42) | 6 | 7 | All of the members of this team are also full-time employees, it will take good time management to complete the necessary pieces of this project.  |
|Scheduling conflicts (42) | 6 | 7 | All of the members of this team are also full-time employees, there will naturally be weeks where time is at a premium and scheduling could become an issue.  |
|External commitment interference (42) | 6 | 7 | All of the members of this team are also full-time employees and some have families and other external commitments, there will be times where these could interfere.  |
|Varying commitment levels (42) | 6 | 7 | Not all team members will feel the same level of commitment to the project, this could become an issue.  |
|Divergent research methodologies (20) | 4 | 5 | Not all team members will have the same thought processes or plans for research methodology.  |
|Difficulty synthesizing individual findings (20) | 4 | 5 | In instances where individual research is needed, synthesizing everyone's findings could become an issue.  |
|Misaligned research objectives (20) | 4 | 5 | It is important to set expectations for objectives at the beginning of the project and keep them appropriately set throughout the project. |
