# Progress Report - Milestone 2

[HOME](https://github.com/adamspanier/Distributed-Systems-Security)

<hr>

## Progress Report Week of 2/24/2025

### Report Overview
  * Worked toward corrections on Executive Summary specifics
  * Refined Reserach questions
  * Expanded and corrected Technical Plan
  * Explored Python and Docker Deployment Options
  * Documented possible deployment options
  * Tested ICS system emulation using Docker
  * Started creating the list of assets in a DCS and threats associated with said assets
  * Started a list of Asset/Threat pairs for the team to review 

### Outcomes
  * _Executive Summary Changes_
    * Problem Statement
      * Verbiage reduced
      * Terminology corrected to be consistent
      * Detail provided regarding "novel"
    * Goals and Objectives
      * Goals changed from phases to actual goals of the project
      * Goals and objectives explained in detail
    * Research Question
     * Research question added
     * Questions revised and made more concise

  * _Expanded Technical Plan_
    * Phases reassesed and renamed
    * Data collection specified
    * Progress methodology given more detail
    * More clarity provided on the benefit of this research
    * Requirements engineering carried out to determine Functional and Non-Functional requirements

  * _Populated an extensive list of ICS Assets_
    *  Hardware, Software, Data, Communation, Human, and Orgainzational assets identified

  * _Populated an extensive list of ICS Threats_
    * Archteictural, Operational, Cyber Attacks, Insider, Governance and Compliance, Supply China, Physical, and Environemntal threats identitified

  * _Created Asset/Threat Groups_
    * Threats were gathered into groups related to the assets stated above

  * _Explored System Emulation Software_
    * Python packages explored, but insufficient packages found
    * Docker images explored, as a reasonable alternateive
    * Docker emulation system successfully deployed
    * Expansion on Docker systems

### Hindrances
  * Listing critical assets in a distributed control system that require security protection include operational technology components, communication infrastructure, system data, and support systems.
  * Python coding packages seem insufficient for testing environments
  * A lack of definition in initial design caused a re-assessment to be done

### Ongoing Risks
|Risk name (value)  | Impact     | Likelihood | Description | Occurrence?| Mitigation |
|-------------------|------------|------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
|Limited academic research on specific PLC vulnerabilities (64) | 8 | 8 | This project hinges on expanding upon previous academic research; if there is not a sufficient amount of research, it could hamper the project.  |
|Constrained testing environments (64) | 8 | 8 | Any testing done on PLC's will be on virtual devices, this could create constraints.  | Yes | Progressive exploration of alternative solutions 
|Difficulty obtaining comprehensive attack surface data (48) | 6 | 8 | The team needs to know what they are protecting in order to attempt to protect it, if this cannot be obtained, it will hamper the project's path forward.  |
|Inability to simulate real-world attack scenarios (48) | 8 | 6 | The project will culminate with a simulation of cryptography working on a PLC, simulation could be an issue.  |
|Challenges in demonstrating practical exploits (42) | 7 | 6 | The team will not have access to physical PLC's for testing, this could present challenges in simulation and demonstration.  |
|Hardware-level security limitations (42) | 6 | 7 | Due to testing being completed on virtual devices, there will be limitations in what can be completed on them.   |
|Time management challenges (42) | 6 | 7 | All of the members of this team are also full-time employees, it will take good time management to complete the necessary pieces of this project.  | Yes | Task reassignment based on availability of members
|Scheduling conflicts (42) | 6 | 7 | All of the members of this team are also full-time employees, there will naturally be weeks where time is at a premium and scheduling could become an issue.  |
|External commitment interference (42) | 6 | 7 | All of the members of this team are also full-time employees and some have families and other external commitments, there will be times where these could interfere.  |
|Varying commitment levels (42) | 6 | 7 | Not all team members will feel the same level of commitment to the project, this could become an issue.  |
|Cryptographic implementation flaws (40) | 8 | 5 | Issues with implementing the correct cryptography protocol  |
|Varied understanding of industrial control systems (40) | 5 | 8 | Not all team members have experience working with ICS systems.  | Yes | Progressive education on how these systems work
|Different technical programming skill levels (40) | 5 | 8 | Each team member comes from a different technological background, not all have strong programming or scripting skills.  |
|Ethical considerations in vulnerability research (40) | 5 | 8 | Vulnerability research always involves ethics. The team needs to keep in mind ethical considerations for all paths taken and decisions made.  |
|Individual motivation inconsistencies (30) | 6 | 5 | People could face issues with other classes or in their personal lives where motivation to work on this project becomes an issue.  |
|Personality conflicts (30) | 5 | 6 | People don't always communicate well, there will be times where people do not "get along" and conflicts could arise.  | No | Na
|Communication breakdowns (24) | 4 | 6 | People don't always communicate well, there will be times where communication suffers and could break down.  |
|Unequal workload distribution (24) | 4 | 6 | A full team of 5 people could lead to an unequal workload distribution.  |
|Misaligned project expectations (20) | 4 | 5 | It is important to set expectations at the beginning of the project and keep them appropriately set throughout the project.  |
|Divergent research methodologies (20) | 4 | 5 | Not all team members will have the same thought processes or plans for research methodology.  |
|Difficulty synthesizing individual findings (20) | 4 | 5 | In instances where individual research is needed, synthesizing everyone's findings could become an issue.  |
|Misaligned research objectives (20) | 4 | 5 | It is important to set expectations for objectives at the beginning of the project and keep them appropriately set throughout the project. |
