# **Sprint Plan Header**
**Project Name:** Distributed Industrial Control Systems Security  
**Sprint Name:** Python-Based Simulation Deployment & Novel DCS Design<br>
**Date:** Friday, February 14, 2025

# **Sprint Plan Duration**  
**Total Duration:** **4 Weeks**  

# **Sprint Plan Goals**  
1. To develop, test, and deploy a Python-based simulation environment that will support and enable the design of the novel distributed industrial control system.
2. Initiate the design phase of the project and build a preliminary distributed control system with cryptographic integration support.

# **Sprint Plan Table**  

| **Week** | **Description** | **Assignee** | **Acceptance Criteria** |
|----------|---------------|-------------|------------------------|
| **Week 1** | **Determine Python Environment Setup**<br>• Evaluate existing repositories (SCADASim, Cpppo).<br>• Decide whether to use an existing repository or develop a custom one.<br>• Ensure all machines have identical environment variables and dependencies to ensure uniform results. | All Team Members | - A decision is made on the Python environment setup.<br>- The environment is standardized with matching dependencies and variables across all machines. |
| **Week 2** | **Deploy Python Simulation Environment** (Part 1)<br>• Install the chosen simulation environment.<br>• Resolve any deployment issues. | All Team Members | - Environment is installed and running on all team members' machines. |
| **Week 3** | **Deploy Python Simulation Environment** (Part 2)<br>• Finalize deployment configurations across all team members' machines.<br>• Develop and conduct baseline tests to verify simulation environment uniformity.<br>• Adjust simulation environment configurations to ensure identical system behavior.<br>• Document final deployment process. | All Team Members | - All machines produce identical results in simulation tests.<br>- Documentation is complete for future deployments. |
| **Week 4** | **Design Novel DCS**<br>• Research past DCS cryptographic implementations (successes and failures) from literature reviews.<br>• Develop a preliminary DCS design and begin integrating cryptographic functions. | All Team Members | - Initial DCS design is created.<br>- The system meets baseline project expectations. |
