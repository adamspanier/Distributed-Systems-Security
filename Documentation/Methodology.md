## 1.0 Literature Review Methodology

This research uses a three step literature review methodology to generate a literature corpus for further analysis. The three steps used are: _1) the literature search, 2) literature selection_, and _3) literature synthesis_. The literature search sees a keyword-based search string applied to two research databases. The literature selection process applies specific criteria to each pertinent paper for inclusion into the research corpus. Finally, the literature synthesis section discusses the findings of the literature search.

The literature review sees a set of keywords combined into logical search strings. These strings are applied to two specific databases. The query results are analyzed and literature in the results that meets selection criteria are added to the research corpus. Upon the completion of the corpus, all added literature is analyzed, grouped, categorized, and discussed regarding relevance to the topic of this research.

### 1.1 Literature Search Keywords

The literature search uses the following keywords: 
1. _PLC_
2. _Programmable Logic Controller_
3. _Blockchain_
4. _Fingerprinting_

These keywords are used due to their relevance to the topic at hand. Terms _one (1)_ and _two (2)_ relate to PLCs and terms _three (3)_ and _four (4)_ relate to decentralized or novel cryptographic applications.

The following terms are also used due to the discovery of emergent terminology in applying the search method:
1. _IIoT_
2. _Industry 4.0_

Based on the keywords above, the following search strings are used:
1. _PLC Blockchain_
2. _PLC Fingerprinting_
3. _Programmable Logic Controller Blockchain_
4. _Programmable Logic Controller Fingerprinting_
5. _IIoT_
6. _Industry 4.0_

### 1.2 Literature Search Databases

The following Databases will be used in this literature search:
1. _IEEE Xplore_
2. _The ACM Digital Library_

During the search, snowballing will be used to add pertinent literature to the selection candidates.

### 1.3 Literature selection

To be added to the research corpus, each relevant literature candidate must be:
1. _relevant to the research topic_
2. _published in either an IEEE or ACM sanctioned publication_
3. _a full research paper_
4. _written in English_
5. _published within the last five (5) years_

Upon addition to the research corpus, snowballing can be used to add related works to the literature corpus for review.

### 1.4 Literature Synthesis

Upon completion of the research corpus, the included literature will be analyzed for common themes. Literature with similar themes will be grouped together. Each grouping will be categorized and given a name. Each category will be described briefly based on the literature included, and an overview of the findings will be discussed.

## 2.0 Literature Review

### 2.1 Review Results

After conduction the systematic literature review described above, nineteen (19) relevant pieces of literature were added to the research corpus. From these works, _____ categories emerged.
The annotated bibliography produced in this literature survey can be found [HERE](https://github.com/adamspanier/Distributed-Systems-Security/blob/main/Documentation/AnnotatedBibliography.md).
