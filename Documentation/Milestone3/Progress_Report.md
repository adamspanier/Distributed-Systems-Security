### Ongoing Risks
|Risk name (value)  | Impact     | Likelihood | Description | Occurrence?| Mitigation |
|-------------------|------------|------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
|Limited academic research on specific PLC vulnerabilities (64) | 8 | 8 | This project hinges on expanding upon previous academic research; if there is not a sufficient amount of research, it could hamper the project.  | No| |
|Constrained testing environments (64) | 8 | 8 | Any testing done on PLCs will be on virtual devices; this could create constraints.  | Yes | Progressive exploration of alternative solutions 
|Difficulty obtaining comprehensive attack surface data (48) | 6 | 8 | The team needs to know what they are protecting to attempt to protect it; if this cannot be obtained, it will hamper the project's path forward.  | Yes | Minimize attack cross-section so that we get good data
|Inability to simulate real-world attack scenarios (48) | 8 | 6 | The project will culminate with a simulation of cryptography working on a PLC; simulation could be an issue.  | No | Scenario hasn't yet arisen 
|Challenges in demonstrating practical exploits (42) | 7 | 6 | The team will not have access to physical PLCs for testing; this could present challenges in simulation and demonstration.  | No | Scenario hasn't yet arisen 
|Hardware-level security limitations (42) | 6 | 7 | Due to testing being completed on virtual devices, there will be limitations in what can be completed on them.   | No
|Time management challenges (42) | 6 | 7 | All of the members of this team are also full-time employees; it will take good time management to complete the necessary pieces of this project.  | Yes | Task reassignment based on availability of members
|Scheduling conflicts (42) | 6 | 7 | All of the members of this team are also full-time employees; there will naturally be weeks where time is at a premium, and scheduling could become an issue.  | Yes | Weekly team meeting modified to accommodate. |
|External commitment interference (42) | 6 | 7 | All of the members of this team are also full-time employees, and some have families and other external commitments; there will be times when these could interfere.  | Yes | Weekly team meeting modified to accommodate. |
|Varying commitment levels (42) | 6 | 7 | Not all team members will feel the same level of commitment to the project; this could become an issue.  | Yes | Continung effort in improving communication
|Cryptographic implementation flaws (40) | 8 | 5 | Issues with implementing the correct cryptography protocol  | No
|Varied understanding of industrial control systems (40) | 5 | 8 | Not all team members have experience working with ICS systems.  | Yes | Progressive education on how these systems work
|Different technical programming skill levels (40) | 5 | 8 | Each team member comes from a different technological background; not all have strong programming or scripting skills.  | Yes | Less technical members rely on the technical members and fill gaps when applicable. |
|Ethical considerations in vulnerability research (40) | 5 | 8 | Vulnerability research always involves ethics. The team needs to keep in mind ethical considerations for all paths taken and decisions made.  | No |
|Individual motivation inconsistencies (30) | 6 | 5 | People could face issues with other classes or in their personal lives where motivation to work on this project becomes an issue.  | Yes | Continuing communication efforts
|Personality conflicts (30) | 5 | 6 | People don't always communicate well; there will be times when people do not "get along," and conflicts could arise.  | No | Scenario hasn't arisen yet
|Communication breakdowns (24) | 4 | 6 | People don't always communicate well; there will be times when communication suffers and breaks down.  | Yes | Lack of communication between weeks with no meetings. |
|Unequal workload distribution (24) | 4 | 6 | A full team of 5 people could lead to an unequal workload distribution.  | Yes | Intentional rebalancing of work
|Misaligned project expectations (20) | 4 | 5 | It is important to set expectations at the beginning of the project and keep them appropriately set throughout the project.  | Yes | Regular re-evaluations of the system
|Divergent research methodologies (20) | 4 | 5 | Not all team members will have the same thought processes or plans for research methodology.  | No |
|Difficulty synthesizing individual findings (20) | 4 | 5 | In instances where individual research is needed, synthesizing everyone's findings could become an issue.  | No | 
|Misaligned research objectives (20) | 4 | 5 | It is important to set expectations for objectives at the beginning of the project and keep them appropriately set throughout the project. | No |
