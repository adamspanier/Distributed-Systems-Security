# Progress Report 2/28/2025
## Overview
Went through and started creating the list of assets in a DCS and threats associated with said assets. Started a list of Asset/Threat pairs for the team to review. 

## Outcomes
Was able to populate a rather extensive list for Brevin to add to, and for the rest of the team to review as we continue working on the project. 


## Hindrances
Thinking through the security of a DCS and what that actually looks like and how threats can affect those assets. 

## Ongoing Risks
|Risk name (value)  | Impact     | Likelihood | Description | Occurrence ?| Mitigation |
|-------------------|------------|------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
|Some risk (40) | 8 | 5 | Some description  | y/n | Description|
