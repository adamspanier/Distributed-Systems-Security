# Python Simulation Tools 

In this section, an exploration of potential Python tools for DCS and SCADA system emulation are explored. 

### Tool Purpose

This research work uses the following proces:

1. Survey existing DCS and SCADA architectural devices and networking designs
2. Identify the most commons assets and functions in these systems
3. Determine the most common threats to the assets and functions of these systems
4. Discover potential decentralized security control processes to mitigate these threats
5. Design a novel DCS design using a standard DCS architecture augmented by novel decentralized controls
6. Model the novel design in emulation software
7. Test the system digitally to determine functionality, efficiency, and functionality of the added security controls

Based on this research design, a tool will be needed to implement the novel design and test its functionality. From the design stated above, the Python-based emulation tool must allow coders to deploy and connect a variety of different DCS devices and configurations. To this deployed network, the tool must enable coders to augment the system with novel security systems. After adding these systems, the tool must allow coders to run the system both with and without the security controls to determine the effectiveness of the security controls as well as the burden the novel controls place on the system. Due to the constraints above, the tool chosen must be flexible, and likely open-source, such that researchers can not only use the intended functionality fo the tool, but also augment the functions with custom code structures.

### Tool Requirements

To satisfy the requirements set out by the research design stated above, the Python-based tool must:

* provide **virtual representations of common DCS devices**
* facilitate **custom DCS device configurations**
* allow **flexible DCS device connections and custom network designs**
* supply **distributed network traffic emulation**
* allow **the DCS system to run**
* provide **network traffic inspection**
* supply **network device inspection and state analysis**
* facilitate the **addition of security controls**
* Allow the **integration of decentralized security tools**
* provide **analysis functions** to determine _system speed, efficiency, and functionality_
