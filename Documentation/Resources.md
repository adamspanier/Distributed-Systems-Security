What do you need to be successful?

|Resource  | Dr. Hale needed? | Investigating Team member | Description |
|-------------------|---------|---------------------------|-------------|
|Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC) | No | ? |Small hardware/software components that pair sensors with actuators via a small ladder logic software package to carry out physical operations in the real world |
|Hardware Fingerprint Authorization | No | ? |Biometric Authentication that uses unique biological traits, in this case fingerprint, for authentication. Provides strong authentication but requires specialized hardware implimentation|
|Python | No | ? |Beginner level coding language that will be the main coding langauge for our Simulations |
|Data Encryption | No| ? |Data/Endpoint encryption is extremely important whem it comes to the security of the Distributed System |
|Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) | No | ? |Network security tool that monitors network traffic and devices for known malicious activity, suspicious activity, or security policy violations |
|Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)| No | ? |Monitors network traffic for potential threats and automatically blocks them by terminating dangerous connections, removing malicious content, or triggering other security devices |
|Emulation Program using Python| No | All | We will be using a program written in Python to emulate a distributed system once we reach the testing phase. There are multiple github repo's to choose from, one will be chosen according to ease of use and need. |
