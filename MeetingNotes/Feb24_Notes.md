Work with novel – be more concise

RQ – maybe reword the question

the novelty is that it is applied to DCS… be more concise 
To what extent are “novel” things in use?
What if any of these techniques could be used to secure distributed control systems… see slack

The novelty is how we overcome these things!

Work that executive summary!

Technical plan

What data do we want to capture…?
How do we define operational impact?
More than just message delay, but also more… Not just fast, but also quality.
Maybe try to quantify that more a bit on that data collection.

Functional – system will have 98% up time
Non-functional – Log is written at some point
The system SHALL do xyz
Take a piece of a real system, use it, and then determine how to test it. - centrifuge or power lines, etc.
Eliminate the term “normal operations”
Create operational system state graph and work with it a bit
Maybe some data out there how some systems work?
Say we will run the system and baseline it.
	High traffic, low traffic, high use, low use, etc.
	Create

3.1.2 – Correct to Design

Also talk about the research side of data collection.
Could take a requirements issue approach…
Get at what proper function is
    • Use functional and non-functional requirements and tests for them – unit testing
        ◦ Pinned to a single component
    • Acceptance testing – Boolean measurements
        ◦ User level
    • Integration test – two or more components interacting

Let’s get some requirements together.
Requirements elicitation – lucid chart or something
