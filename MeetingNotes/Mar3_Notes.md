Meeting notes
March 3, 2025

We can actually make our own images with Python and have it communicate on the network

Refer to those other microservices just by there service name

	Make a network request to the Python

We can do attack modeling here
Encapsulate the attacks – on same network.. not same, etc.

port mapping allows external stuff – 80:80 → from 80 to public 80

Can refer to services by name using Requests --> For instance: plc1:50
